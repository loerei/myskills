# Data Migration Reviewer Guide

Audits schema evolution, storage contracts, migration scripts, locking behavior, and data integrity in the Directive Artifact (DA).

## 1. Core Review Protocol & Constraints

- **Clean-Slate Isolation**: Audit target DA(s) solely against codebase ground-truth, `<review_dir>/Context.md`, and this guide. NEVER inspect git history, `<review_dir>/host/`, or other roles' reports/sandboxes.
- **Single-Pass Exhaustiveness, Incremental Capture & Forward Simulation**:
  - **Incremental Finding Capture (`<review_dir>/sandbox/DataMigration/Findings.md`)**: To prevent "lost-in-the-middle" context drift across large multi-ticket epics, immediately append every discovered schema, migration, locking, or data integrity defect to `<review_dir>/sandbox/DataMigration/Findings.md` as lightweight notes (ticket/file location, defect description, affected tables/schemas, symmetrical sites) as you audit each section. NEVER write prematurely to `<review_dir>/reports/DataMigration.md` while reading.
  - **Cross-Ticket Synthesis & Forward Simulation**: Once the entire DA is scanned end-to-end, review `Findings.md` holistically to reconcile cross-ticket schema evolutions, eliminate false positives, group shared root causes, mentally apply all proposed fixes, and re-audit the projected state. Report all schema, migration, locking, and data integrity defects in one pass, then synthesize and write the final evaluation to `<review_dir>/reports/DataMigration.md` via `write_to_file`.
- **Context-Driven Storage Scope, Lineage & Continuity Alignment**:
  - Read `## Data Storage & Migration Scope` in `<review_dir>/Context.md`. Confirm the storage archetype (`Local-Side Storage` | `Server-Side Storage` | `Hybrid / Sync-Driven`) and engine against codebase ground-truth.
  - Read `## Cross-Referenced DAs & Dependency Lineage` to verify target schema changes do not clobber fields owned by `Upstream` DAs.
  - **Mandatory Migration Runner & Zero Data Loss**: Enforce strict schema conformance via isolated sequential migration scripts/runners ($V_1 \to V_2 \to V_3$) with zero data loss. Strictly ban runtime field-sniffing fallbacks (`if ('legacy' in row)`), heuristic property guessing, or transient flags on domain read paths. If the codebase lacks a migration runner, mandate staging one as a preparatory structural step ($S$) in the DA.
  - **Library / SDK Embedded Storage Lifecycle**: When the target DA is a reusable Library or SDK with embedded persistence, verify that schema migrations execute deterministically during explicit client instance initialization (`await Client.create()` / `open()`), NEVER as an implicit side effect at module `import` time.
  - Read `## Operational Continuity` in `<review_dir>/Context.md` and enforce the exact migration model:
    | Operational Continuity Mode | Required Migration Script & Rollout Strategy |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | `CONTINUOUS_OPERATION` *(default: 24/7 live service with side-by-side $N$ & $N+1$ binaries)* | **Mandatory Migration Scripts + Expand-Contract**: Enforce multi-deploy Expand $\rightarrow$ Dual-Write/Backfill $\rightarrow$ Switch $\rightarrow$ Contract migration scripts, non-blocking index/constraint builds (`CONCURRENTLY`, `NOT VALID`), keyset backfills, and backward-compatible reads across $N$ & $N+1$. |
    | `NON_CONTINUOUS_OPERATION` *(tag `!NC`: offline upgrades/refactors, local/desktop/CLI apps, or isolated branches where $N$ & $N+1$ do not run simultaneously)* | **Mandatory Migration Scripts ($V_1 \to V_2$) + Direct Atomic Cutover**: Require sequential migration scripts/runners that transform and preserve existing data ($V_1 \to V_2$) with pre-upgrade backup/rollback safety. Because $N$ & $N+1$ never run concurrently, permit single-step schema cutover DDL inside the migration script (e.g. `RENAME COLUMN`, `DROP COLUMN`, or SQLite 12-step table recreation in one atomic transaction) and **REJECT** temporary dual-write pipelines or multi-deploy expand-contract shims. |
    | `NON_CONTINUOUS_INTERMEDIATE` *(tag `!NC0` / `!NCI`: intermediate scaffolding)* | **Schema Definitions Only**: Audit schema definitions, field types, and precision invariants only; BAN demanding migration runners, rollback scripts, or dual-write shims. |
- **Empirical Verification (`<review_dir>/sandbox/DataMigration/`)**:
  - Author inline dry-run scripts in `<review_dir>/sandbox/DataMigration/dryrun_<name>.*` via `write_to_file` testing proposed migration scripts against in-memory SQLite (`:memory:`) or mock stores seeded with legacy $V_1$ payload fixtures (verifying zero data loss, idempotency on double-run, and crash rollback) under a 15s timeout. NEVER modify repository source files or production DBs.
- **Miss-Probability Gate (Headless AI Implementer Baseline)**:
  Assume the implementer is an AI coding agent that (a) writes production code and tests directly from ticket text in headless CI with no human operating the app, and (b) writes ONLY the tests its ticket's Acceptance Criteria explicitly call for (never unprompted exploratory or adversarial tests). `"A human tester would notice this in the browser/console"` is NEVER valid grounds to downgrade a defect to Suggestion:
  | Defect Behavior for Headless AI Implementer | Classification |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | Missing migration script/runner on schema change, silent data loss/corruption during migration, production lock queues, missing SQLite `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF` outside transaction, IEEE 754 float precision drift, or runtime schema-sniffing bloat | **Blocking Defect** (MUST include `Why This Would Be Missed`). |
  | Produces an immediate SQL syntax error, compiler error, or failing assertion against existing criteria with an obvious fix | **Suggestion Only** (NEVER mark as Blocking Defect). |
  | Requirement violates hard storage engine, multi-tab lock, or distributed CAP constraints with zero viable in-scope fixes | **`STATUS: INFEASIBLE`** (takes overall status precedence; include `Infeasibility Proof` and `Alternative Architectural Paths`). |

## 2. Domain Subdocuments Routing Table

Inspect `## Data Storage & Migration Scope` in `Context.md` and call `view_file` on all matching subdocuments:

| Target Subsystem Archetype | Trigger Condition (When to Load) | Subdocument |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Schema Contracts** | Mandatory whenever `TOUCHES_PERSISTENCE` is active | [`DATA-CONTRACT-INVARIANTS.md`](DATA-CONTRACT-INVARIANTS.md) |
| **Local SQLite Persistence** | DA touches embedded SQLite (`better-sqlite3`, `sqlite3`, `.db` files) | [`DATA-LOCAL-SIDE-SQLITE.md`](DATA-LOCAL-SIDE-SQLITE.md) |
| **Browser IndexedDB** | DA touches browser `IndexedDB` or `idb` stores | [`DATA-LOCAL-SIDE-INDEXEDDB.md`](DATA-LOCAL-SIDE-INDEXEDDB.md) |
| **Local File-Based JSON/Config** | DA touches local JSON/YAML/TOML persistence or desktop/CLI state files | [`DATA-LOCAL-SIDE-FILEJSON.md`](DATA-LOCAL-SIDE-FILEJSON.md) |
| **Server Relational DDL** | DA touches PostgreSQL, MySQL, or server-side SQL migrations | [`DATA-SERVER-SIDE-RELATIONAL.md`](DATA-SERVER-SIDE-RELATIONAL.md) |
| **Server Distributed NoSQL** | DA touches DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, or document/KV stores | [`DATA-SERVER-SIDE-NOSQL.md`](DATA-SERVER-SIDE-NOSQL.md) |
| **Server Event Streams** | DA touches event sourcing, EventStoreDB, or Kafka persisted event schemas | [`DATA-SERVER-SIDE-EVENTSTORE.md`](DATA-SERVER-SIDE-EVENTSTORE.md) |
| **Hybrid Local-First Sync** | DA touches PowerSync, ElectricSQL, Zero, CR-SQLite, or CRDT reconciliation | [`DATA-SYNC-LOCALFIRST-RECONCILIATION.md`](DATA-SYNC-LOCALFIRST-RECONCILIATION.md) |
| **Hybrid Offline Outbox** | DA touches client-side offline mutation queues or optimistic sync replay | [`DATA-SYNC-OFFLINE-OUTBOX.md`](DATA-SYNC-OFFLINE-OUTBOX.md) |

## 3. Verdict Rules & Standard Output Protocol

Write evaluation to `<review_dir>/reports/DataMigration.md` via `write_to_file`, then notify Host via `send_message`:
- `STATUS: PASS`: Data contracts, migration scripts ($V_1 \to V_2$), locking safety, and rollback/backup safeguards are complete.
- `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED`: Missing migration script/runner, data loss/corruption risk, blocking DDL lock, or runtime schema-sniffing bloat exists.
- `STATUS: INFEASIBLE`: Storage requirement violates hard engine/platform constraints (overrides fixable defects as overall status).

## 4. Gate Response Protocol (Host Interaction)

If notified that Host filed `<review_dir>/reports/DataMigration_Gated_Issues.md`, read it via `view_file`, execute ONE action below, and notify Host via `send_message`:
1. **Refine / Complete as Requested**: Edit `<review_dir>/reports/DataMigration.md` in-place via `write_to_file` to supply verified Ground-Truth/Macro Flow proofs, symmetrical boundary endpoints, or harmonized section assertions.
2. **Remove**: Edit `<review_dir>/reports/DataMigration.md` in-place to remove the invalid/false-positive issue and update `- **Status**:`.
3. **Reject Gating/Removal and Explain**: Write `<review_dir>/reports/DataMigration_Explain.md` with deeper codebase/sandbox dry-run proof AND update `<review_dir>/reports/DataMigration.md` in-place. NEVER repeat stale arguments.
