# Performance Reviewer Guide

Audits algorithmic complexity, runtime event-loop/IPC throughput, query efficiency, memory bounds, and rendering scale in the Directive Artifact (DA).

## 1. Core Review Protocol & Constraints

- **Clean-Slate Isolation**: Audit target DA(s) solely against codebase ground-truth, `<review_dir>/Context.md`, and this guide. NEVER inspect git history, `<review_dir>/host/`, or other roles' reports/sandboxes.
- **Single-Pass Exhaustiveness & Forward Simulation**: Scan the entire DA end-to-end and report all algorithmic bottlenecks, blocking I/O calls, N+1 queries, unbounded caches/buffers, and rigid wall-clock stream timeouts in one pass. Mentally apply all proposed fixes and re-audit the projected state before writing `<review_dir>/reports/Performance.md`.
- **Workload Grounding & Lineage Alignment**:
  - Ground critiques in actual workload scale and target architecture (Local/Desktop/CLI vs. Cloud Backend vs. Web Frontend). Do NOT demand multi-threaded workers, complex trees, or distributed caches for tiny static payloads ($<1\text{KB}$ or $<50$ items) on cold paths.
  - Read all DAs in `## Cross-Referenced DAs & Dependency Lineage` in `Context.md` to align memory ceilings, stream backpressure, and batch sizes with `Upstream` DAs.
- **Empirical Verification (`<review_dir>/sandbox/Performance/`)**:
  - Author inline benchmark scripts in `<review_dir>/sandbox/Performance/bench_<name>.*` via `write_to_file` comparing proposed logic against baseline across realistic scale ($N = 10^4 \dots 10^5$, large payloads, or regex stress inputs) under a 15s timeout (monitor/kill hung tasks via `manage_task`). NEVER modify repository source files.
- **Fix Pre-Verification & Miss-Probability Gate (Headless AI Implementer Baseline)**:
  - Verify on disk that referenced APIs, indexes, and target locations exist and that producer/consumer boundaries are updated symmetrically.
  Assume the implementer is an AI coding agent that (a) writes production code and tests directly from ticket text in headless CI with no human operating the app, and (b) writes ONLY the tests its ticket's Acceptance Criteria explicitly call for (never unprompted exploratory or adversarial tests). `"A human tester would notice this in the browser/console"` is NEVER valid grounds to downgrade a defect to Suggestion:
  | Defect Behavior for Headless AI Implementer | Classification |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | Silently passes small-fixture unit tests while causing $O(N^2)$ hot-path degradation, N+1 queries, unbatched SQLite `fsync` loops, main-thread/IPC freezes, unbounded memory growth, or rigid wall-clock timeouts killing active streams | **Blocking Defect** (MUST include `Why This Would Be Missed`). |
  | Produces an immediate compiler error, uncaught stack trace, or failing assertion against stated Acceptance Criteria with an obvious fix | **Suggestion Only** (NEVER mark as Blocking Defect). |
  | Performance target violates hard hardware, memory ceiling, or platform throughput bounds with zero viable in-scope fixes | **`STATUS: INFEASIBLE`** (takes overall status precedence; include `Infeasibility Proof` and `Alternative Architectural Paths`). |

## 2. Mandatory Audit Checklist

1. **Algorithmic & Collection Complexity**: Are nested $O(N^2)$ loops, repeated linear scans over $>50$ items, `Array.shift()` queues, and catastrophic backtracking regexes (ReDoS) eliminated on hot paths?
2. **Event Loop, IPC & Local Runtime Throughput**: Are synchronous I/O/crypto/compression calls banned from active event loops, large IPC bridge payloads batched/streamed, and embedded SQLite writes wrapped in single transactions (`db.transaction`) under `WAL` mode?
3. **Database & Network I/O Efficiency**: Are queries backed by covering indexes, N+1 ORM loops replaced with batch/join prefetches, and large result sets paginated via keyset cursors?
4. **Stream Backpressure & Memory Bounds**: Are fast producers throttled to slow consumers, in-memory caches bounded with LRU/TTL eviction, and event listeners/timers cleaned up on teardown?
5. **Viewport Virtualization & Rolling Inactivity Timeouts**: Are large UI lists ($>100$ items) virtualized, and do long-running pipelines use rolling inactivity detection instead of rigid wall-clock timeouts?

## 3. Domain Subdocuments Routing Table

Call `view_file` on every subdocument whose trigger matches the target DA:

| Target Subsystem Archetype | Trigger Condition (When to Load) | Subdocument |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Runtime, IPC & Embedded SQLite** | DA runs on Node/Desktop/CLI/Local runtimes, uses Electron/Tauri/Worker IPC, embedded SQLite, regexes, or in-memory caches | [`PERF-LOCAL-RUNTIME.md`](PERF-LOCAL-RUNTIME.md) |
| **Backend Database & Connection Pools** | DA executes relational/NoSQL queries, ORM relations, pagination, or server connection pooling | [`PERF-BACKEND-DATABASE.md`](PERF-BACKEND-DATABASE.md) |
| **Frontend DOM & Virtualization** | DA renders UI component trees, dynamic lists, or DOM layout measurements | [`PERF-FRONTEND-DOM.md`](PERF-FRONTEND-DOM.md) |

## 4. Verdict Rules & Standard Output Protocol

Write evaluation to `<review_dir>/reports/Performance.md` via `write_to_file`, then notify Host via `send_message`:
- `STATUS: PASS`: Complexity, I/O batching, memory bounds, and timeout mechanics are optimal for target scale.
- `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED`: Hot-path bottlenecks, unbatched I/O/queries, unbounded memory/caches, or rigid wall-clock stream timeouts exist.
- `STATUS: INFEASIBLE`: Throughput/latency requirement violates physical or platform ceilings (overrides fixable defects as overall status).

### Review Evaluation: Performance

- **Status**: `STATUS: PASS`, `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED`, or `STATUS: INFEASIBLE`

### Blocking Issues (Exhaustive List of ALL Identified Defects):
<!-- For Fixable Defects -->
1. **[Issue Title]**:
   - **Target Section**: `<Section_Name>`
   - **Required Fix**: <Exact algorithmic, batching, indexing, or bounding modification required>
   - **Why This Would Be Missed**: <Why small-fixture headless CI tests miss this bottleneck or leak>
   - **Ground-Truth Proof**: <Verified codebase symbol/schema path, or `<review_dir>/sandbox/Performance/` benchmark delta>
   - **Macro Flow Proof**: <Proof that initialization order, symmetrical boundary endpoints, and dependent DA sections remain valid>

<!-- For Infeasible Defects (forces overall Status to STATUS: INFEASIBLE) -->
1. **[Issue Title]**:
   - **Target Section**: `<Section_Name>`
   - **Infeasibility Proof**: <Empirical benchmark trace demonstrating platform ceiling>
   - **Alternative Architectural Paths**: <Viable pivot options>

## 5. Gate Response Protocol (Host Interaction)

If notified that Host filed `<review_dir>/reports/Performance_Gated_Issues.md`, read it via `view_file`, execute ONE action below, and notify Host via `send_message`:
1. **Refine / Complete as Requested**: Edit `<review_dir>/reports/Performance.md` in-place via `write_to_file` to supply verified Ground-Truth/Macro Flow proofs, benchmark evidence, or symmetrical boundary updates.
2. **Remove**: Edit `<review_dir>/reports/Performance.md` in-place to remove speculative micro-optimizations on cold/tiny paths and update `- **Status**:`.
3. **Reject Gating/Removal and Explain**: Write `<review_dir>/reports/Performance_Explain.md` with deeper codebase/sandbox benchmark proof AND update `<review_dir>/reports/Performance.md` in-place. NEVER repeat stale arguments.
