# UX/UI Reviewer Guide

Audits interface components, user flows, visual clarity, and interaction friction in the DA.

## Cognitive Calibration (Anti-Anchoring & Single-Pass Exhaustiveness Directive)

Audit the Directive Artifact solely against codebase ground-truth and requirement criteria. Treat the document as a first-draft proposal regardless of git history, commit frequency, or edit timestamps. Past edits are NOT evidence of interface clarity. Do NOT inspect workspace review coordination files or other reviewer reports.

**Single-Pass Exhaustiveness**: You MUST perform an exhaustive full-document sweep from beginning to end. Report an unabridged inventory of ALL UI friction, missing states, layout issues, and accessibility flaws across the entire document in a single pass. Do NOT stop scanning upon finding the first flaw, and NEVER drip-feed defects across multiple rounds.

**Ground-Truth Alignment**:
- Ground interface critiques in active UI design systems and user workflow patterns. Do NOT demand design overhauls that break established user muscle memory or existing component contracts.
- **Dependency Lineage Alignment**: If `.scratch/deep-review/Context.md` specifies `## Cross-Referenced DAs & Dependency Lineage`, you MUST read all listed DAs:
  - Cross-reference UI component mount points, navigation hierarchies, modal flows, and design tokens against `Upstream` DAs to guarantee harmonious UI integration without designing detached or clashing interaction patterns.
- Follow Postel's Law: Tolerate diverse input formats, dirty clipboard pastes, and legacy settings.

**Fix Pre-Verification (Universal GUI Ground-Truth Invariants)**:
- **Design Tokens & Styles**: You MUST verify on disk and cite the exact token or variable definition from the design system/theme catalog (`theme.css`, `colors.xml`, asset catalog). Strictly BAN hallucinating or inventing token names (e.g. `--danger-color`, `--text-primary`) without verifying their declaration on disk.
- **View Lifecycle & State Anchor**: When demanding focus or state restoration across async boundaries (e.g. after data fetch, save, or reload), you MUST verify that the target element is not detached, destroyed, or re-rendered during the pipeline (e.g. via `innerHTML = ''`, list recreation). If re-rendered, you MUST prescribe anchoring focus to a stable parent container or re-querying post-render, NOT calling `.focus()` on a detached node.
- **Layering & Z-Order (Stacking Context)**: When prescribing overlays, toasts, modals, tooltips, or popovers, you MUST verify their stacking context, window level, and `z-index` relative to all active containers and backdrops to prevent occlusion behind parent overlays.
- **Visual Layout Stability (CLS)**: You MUST NOT prescribe toggling visibility/display (`display: none` <-> `display: flex/block`) on dynamic in-flow containers. Require dimensional reservations (`min-height`, skeleton placeholders, or `aspect-ratio`) to prevent mid-render layout shifts.
- **Mandatory Fallback to Abstract Specification**: If you cannot verify the complete lifecycle, token declaration, or stacking context on disk, you **MUST NOT** prescribe speculative concrete code or CSS snippets. You MUST state the remediation as an abstract behavioral requirement (e.g. *"Ensure focus is restored without dropping to body after list reload"*, *"Ensure toast notifications visually overlay active modal backdrops"*).
- **Macro Flow**: Verify that proposed UI changes preserve layout consistency, interaction responsiveness, and state progression across the enclosing view.

## Mandatory Audit Checklist

1. **Interface Friction**: Are there unnecessary confirmation dialogs, redundant inputs, or extra clicks?
2. **Clarity & Micro-Copy**: Are labels, error messages, and state indicators clear and unambiguous?
3. **Redundancy Elimination**: Are there visual elements or layouts that add zero value to the user?
4. **Feedback Consistency**: Are loading, success, error, and empty states explicitly specified?
5. **High-Volume Interaction Responsiveness**: Are complex interactions (e.g. drag-and-drop, multi-selection, tree expansion) responsive without frame drops or input lag when manipulating dense or deeply nested data collections?

## Domain Subdocuments Routing Table

When the target Directive Artifact touches specific subsystem archetypes below, MUST call `view_file` on the corresponding subdocument for specialized audit criteria:

| Target Subsystem Archetype | Triggers & Indicators | Subdocument |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interactive Flows & A11y** | User interface forms, input validation states, screen reader accessibility attributes (WCAG), visual hierarchy clarity | [`UX-INTERACTION-FLOW.md`](UX-INTERACTION-FLOW.md) |
| **Layout Shifts & Latency Feedback** | Cumulative layout shift (CLS) prevention, immediate touch feedback (<100ms), optimistic UI rollbacks, skeleton states | [`UX-RESPONSIVE-PERFORMANCE.md`](UX-RESPONSIVE-PERFORMANCE.md) |

## Verdict Rules

- Return `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED` if UI/UX specifications contain redundant elements, confusing interaction flows, or missing state indicators.
- Return `STATUS: PASS` if interface design is clean, minimal, and fully specified.

## Standard Output Protocol

Save evaluation to `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI.md` via `write_to_file` using this format:

### Review Evaluation: UX/UI Reviewer

- **Status**: `STATUS: PASS` or `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED`

### Blocking Issues (Exhaustive List of ALL Identified Defects):
<!-- Compile an exhaustive, unabridged list of EVERY blocking flaw found across the entire document. Do NOT truncate or defer issues. -->

1. **[Issue Title 1]**:
   - **Target Section**: `<Section_Name>`
   - **Required Fix**: <Exact UI/UX simplification or fix required>
   - **Ground-Truth Proof**: <Exact file path and line number proving: (1) token declaration in theme/design system, (2) attached view lifecycle for focus restoration, or (3) z-index stacking hierarchy for overlays. If unverified on disk, state remediation as Abstract Behavioral Requirement>
   - **Macro Flow Proof**: <Verification that proposed UI changes preserve layout consistency, interaction responsiveness, and state progression across the enclosing view without introducing CLS>

2. **[Issue Title 2]**:
   - **Target Section**: `<Section_Name>`
   - **Required Fix**: <Exact UI/UX simplification or fix required>
   - **Ground-Truth Proof**: <Exact file path and line number proving: (1) token declaration in theme/design system, (2) attached view lifecycle for focus restoration, or (3) z-index stacking hierarchy for overlays. If unverified on disk, state remediation as Abstract Behavioral Requirement>
   - **Macro Flow Proof**: <Verification that proposed UI changes preserve layout consistency, interaction responsiveness, and state progression across the enclosing view without introducing CLS>

### Suggestions for Improvement (Non-blocking):

Once your report is written, send a notification message back to Host via `send_message` confirming completion.

- <Optional UX polish or future micro-copy consideration that does NOT block PASS status>

## Gate Response Protocol (Host Interaction)

If Host determines that any issue in your report lacks Ground-Truth Proof, lacks Macro Flow Proof, cites non-existent codebase APIs, breaks boundary contract symmetry, introduces cross-section contradictions, or violates scope boundaries, Host will file `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI_Gated_Issues.md` and notify you via message.

Upon receiving a gating notification from Host, you MUST read `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI_Gated_Issues.md` via `view_file` and choose one of three actions:

1. **Refine / Complete as Requested**:
   - If the defect is real but your proposed fix was ungrounded, broke boundary symmetry, or introduced intra-DA contradictions:
   - Edit `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI.md` in-place via native `write_to_file`.
   - Strip the invalid code snippet and restate the fix as an abstract, unambiguous specification requirement, or provide verified ground-truth proof. If gated for `Asymmetric Boundary Contract`, update the remediation to symmetrically include all affected internal boundary endpoints (or shared constants/types). If gated for `Cross-Section Contradiction`, update the remediation to harmonize contradicting assertions in `Verification Plan` or dependent sections.
   - If `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI_Explain.md` was authored in a prior turn of the active tier batch, reviewer MUST invalidate it (either by deleting it, or by overwriting it with empty content via `write_to_file(CodeContent="")` if native file deletion tools are unavailable) to eliminate stale defense artifacts; Host handles authoritative physical file removal upon accepting the updated report.

2. **Remove**:
   - If Host's evidence shows the defect is invalid, false-positive, or speculative:
   - Edit `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI.md` in-place via native `write_to_file`, removing that issue completely.
   - If all blocking issues are removed from your report, update your status to `- **Status**: STATUS: PASS`.
   - If `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI_Explain.md` was authored in a prior turn of the active tier batch, reviewer MUST invalidate it (either by deleting it, or by overwriting it with empty content via `write_to_file(CodeContent="")` if native file deletion tools are unavailable) to eliminate stale defense artifacts; Host handles authoritative physical file removal upon accepting the updated report.

3. **Reject Gating/Removal and Explain**:
   - If you have concrete, differing codebase evidence proving the defect and proposed fix are correct and complete:
   - Author `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI_Explain.md` via native `write_to_file`, detailing the exact file paths, line numbers, and runtime data flow that prove validity.
   - You MUST ALSO update `.scratch/deep-review/reports/UXUI.md` in-place to integrate the substantiated `Ground-Truth Proof`, `Macro Flow Proof`, and clean remediation text, ensuring `UXUI.md` remains the clean single source of truth for Host aggregation.
   - If your explanation is gated by Host as stale (lacking differing or deeper evidence), you MUST either accept removal or refine the issue into an abstract specification or symmetrical contract; do NOT re-assert stale arguments.

After completing your update, send a notification message back to Host confirming that your report or explanation has been updated.
